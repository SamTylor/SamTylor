Hi, Iâ€™m @SamTylor 
-----------------
I might come off as a bit mentally challegend but i am actually quite intteligent 

I am Curently 21 i have been intrested in software devlopment since i was 15 and i have been teaching myself how to program 
I have limited resources i don't actually own a desktop my android is my Devemloping platform.

I was born to a uneducated Family that worrys more about fighting
I was born with a social anxiety disorder in a thir world with little to no access to work or oppertunitys 
My Languages are C#, C+, C++, Java, Solidity, Python and Html.
I am quite educated about all the above programming languages even Though i 
have no prior Education Despite my Self Taught skills.

The fact that some are thinking dude get off your ass and find work to pay for the proper 
equipment is understandable but the Employment rate where i live is 14%
-- I am probaly going to regret entrering the next paragraph but i am a new age human and 
belive that you all reading this will understand 
and the only way to 
get a job here is if you are a corrupt person or from african descent-------(This is not in any way intended to be a racial steriotype  or be taken as racism i 
can't stand racism it is meerly a statistic due to our country being free from oppresion only 20 years i don't mean any offensiveness 
so please don't freak out and shun me. my country does'nt have the  freedom of speach most have. and i personaly think that tip toeing around race is raceist)
or if you are willing to steal and lie and with the increase of goverment coruption here Jobs are a scarcity.
My morality and kind nature makes that a impossebility 

I am Also a Superbly talented Project Designer even though my social skills are non existing 
my Technical skills are un matched in my oppinion

i am working on a few projects with 2 that are completetly finished however because i am a one person team 
i am taking a lot of stress and doubt.

I once used a Social media and Designer platform to upload a project and hope to get credibality but it was 
stolen and published - was still a bit greene and it was my mistake

if any one wants to maybe join up in a project, Team Or any other reason contact me on email
